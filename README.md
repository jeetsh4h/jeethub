All the important coursework and projects I have done up until now.

This includes my work in the research assistantship for the mathematical modelling centre for FLAME University.

All of the work above represents my coursework in the the second year of FLAME University.
A new branch will be opened up and all the work done for the third academic year will be uploaded there.
A couple projects were already too big so here is the [link](https://github.com/jeetsh4h/Mario-SJ) to the repository that houses the game we made for the course CSIT302 (Principles of Programming Languages)
